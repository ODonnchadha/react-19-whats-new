## What's New in React 19 by Roland Guijt

- OVERVIEW:
    - This course will teach you how to work with new hooks such as use, useActionState, and useOptimistic (form) actions, and the new possibility to create server components and functions.

- SERVER COMPONENTS AND ACTIONS:
    - Benefits of server-side code:
        - Server-rendered applications:
            - Caching.
            - Secrets: API keys. OAuth tokens.
            - Libraries: Browser receives minimal required.
            - Feels fater: Especially with first access.
                - Otherwise. SPA downloaded. Then data. SPA downloads all at application start.
        - SPA upsides:
            - Smooth UX. No server routes needed. 
                - And, really, no server after initial download. API needed to manage data.
            - Tend to scale better.
            - Offline possibilities.
        - Server-side features offer the best of both worlds. Go figure.
            - Client-side components. Browser-side components. And server-side actions.
